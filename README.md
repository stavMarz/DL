# Deep Learning Course Scripts

Welcome to the Deep Learning Course Scripts repository! This collection of scripts is a culmination of my final semester as part of my thesis education, focusing on the exciting field of deep learning. Throughout this course, I have explored various concepts, algorithms, and techniques in deep learning, and this repository serves as a comprehensive collection of the scripts I have developed during my studies.

## Contents

The repository is organized into different directories, each representing a specific topic or project covered during the course. Each directory contains the necessary scripts, along with any associated data or resources, to understand and reproduce the experiments conducted. Feel free to navigate through the directories and explore the scripts that pique your interest.

## Usage

To utilize these scripts, ensure you have the required dependencies and frameworks installed on your system. Additionally, make sure to refer to the README file within each directory for specific instructions on running the scripts and any additional setup steps that may be required. The code is well-documented with comments to facilitate comprehension and customization, allowing you to adapt it to your own projects or extend it further.

## Contributions

While this repository primarily serves as a personal collection of my work, I welcome contributions from fellow deep learning enthusiasts. If you spot any bugs, have suggestions for improvements, or would like to contribute your own scripts related to the covered topics, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Your contributions are greatly appreciated!
